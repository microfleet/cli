## Usage example

Assuming you are running node 8.x.x, where `npx` is bundled you can do the following
to run commands against AMQP-enabled endpoints

```sh
$ docker exec -it <@microfleet/container-name> sh
$ npx @microfleet/cli -r pdf.render -q {"meta":false,"context":{},"template":"sample"}
```

Response will be printed to stdout/stderr based on success/failure of the request
In the real-world you'd likely want to run some less complicated requests or prepare them
elsewhere and just use this cli to issue requests so that they end up correctly serialized
and response is then correctly deserialized and printed
